The RevitPythonShell adds an IronPython interpreter to Autodesk Revit and Vasari.

The RevitPythonShell (RPS) lets you to write plugins for Revit in Python, my favourite scripting language! But even
better, it provides you with an
interactive shell that lets you see the results of your code *as you type it*. This is great for exploring the Revit API
while
writing your Revit Addins - use this in combination with the [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup)
database exploration tool to become a Revit API Ninja :)

## Features

- interactive IronPython interpreter for exploring the API
    - with syntax highlighting
    - autocompletion (press CTRL+SPACE after a period)
    - based on the [IronLab](http://code.google.com/p/ironlab/) project
- batteries included! (Python standard library is bundled as a resource in the `RpsRuntime.dll`)
- full access to the .NET framework and the Revit API
- configurable "environment" variables that can be used in your scripts
- save "external scripts" for reuse and start collecting your awesome hacks!
- run scripts at Revit startup
- deploy scripts as standalone Revit Addins
- `lookup()` function for snooping `Element`, `ElementSet` and `ElementId` objects
  in [RevitLookup](https://github.com/jeremytammik/RevitLookup)

## IronPython 3

IronPython 3.4 uses Python 3.4 syntax and standard libraries and so your Python code will need to be updated accordingly. There are numerous tools and guides available on the web to help porting from Python 2 to 3.

IronPython 3 targets Python 3, including the re-organized standard library, Unicode strings, and all of the other new features.with user upgrade from **IronPython 2** to **IronPython 3**, please follow [Upgrade from IronPython 2 to IronPython 3](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/blob/master/Documentation/upgrading-from-ipy2.md).

Various differences between IronPython and CPython can follow at [Differences IronPython and CPython](https://github.com/IronLanguages/ironpython3/blob/master/Documentation/differences-from-c-python.md).
