#summary A few screenshots of the plugin

= The MainWindow (RevitPythonShell - Input) =

[http://revitpythonshell.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/MainWindowScreenshot.Png Screenshot of the main window]

The main window is displayed when the plugin is started. This is a very rudimentary editor (a TextBox control) where you can type a python script.

  * the button _Execute_ starts the script in a fresh interpreter
  * output of the script is shown in the OutputWindow (see below)
  * a special variable {{{__revit__}}} can be used. It contains a reference to the {{{Autodesk.Revit.Application}}} object

== Canned commands ==

In the top row of the MainWindow, you can see a button _Interactive_. This is just an example of a canned command - you can add as many as you like. Each such command starts in a now OutputWindow and runs a file as defined in the {{{RevitPythonShell.xml}}} configuration file.

The _Interactive_ command is rather usefull, as it enters a REPL (Read, Execute, Print, Loop) and allows interactive exploration of the RevitAPI.
