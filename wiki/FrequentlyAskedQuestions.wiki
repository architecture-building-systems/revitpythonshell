=== How to use RPS scripts ===

*Q*: How do I use the scripts located at: https://github.com/daren-thomas/rps-sample-scripts and other similar scripts?

*A*:  You can add these scripts to the Toolbar using the configuration dialog. These are sometimes called "canned commands" (we should come up with a better name, though, so if you have one, post it to the group!). See these links for more information:
