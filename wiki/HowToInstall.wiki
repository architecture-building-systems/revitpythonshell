#summary tips on how to get it up and running on your system.

= Introduction =

RevitPythonShell is still a work-in-progress. I have not created an Installer yet, so you are going to get your hands slightly dirty here.

The installation breaks down to following steps:

  * build the {{{RevitPythonShell.dll}}}
  * register it as an external application in Autodesk Revit Architecture 2010
  * configure {{{RevitPythonShell.xml}}}
    * set up
    * add your own canned scripts

= Details =

== Build the {{{RevitPythonShell.dll}}}

  # check out the source code (see http://code.google.com/p/revitpythonshell/source/checkout)
  # open the solution in Visual Studio 2008 and build it
  # remember the output directory of the build (something like 'projectlocation\bin\Debug'

== Register it as an external application in Autodesk Revit Architecture 2010 ==

add something like this to your {{{Revit.ini}}} file (see Revits developer documentation on how to do this):
{{{
[ExternalApplications]
EACount=1
EAName1=RevitPythonShell
EADescription1=
EAAssembly1=C:\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\revitpythonshell\RevitPythonShell\bin\Debug\RevitPythonShell.dll
EAClassName1=RevitPythonShell.RevitPythonShellApplication
}}}

== Configure the {{{RevitPythonShell.xml}}} ==
