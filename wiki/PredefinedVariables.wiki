#summary A list of predefined variables your scripts have access to

= Introduction =

This page provides a list of variables supplied by RevitPythonShell. These are injected into the scope, whenever an InteractiveShell or a CannedCommand is created. Use these variables to interact with Autodesk Revit.

= Details =

|| variable || description || 
|| {{{__revit__}}} || a reference to the {{{Autodesk.Revit.Application}}} instance, obtained from the {{{ExternalCommandData}}} argument passed to plugins. ||
|| {{{__commandData__}}} || the actual {{{ExternalCommandData}}} argument passed to the RevitPythonShell plugin when you clicked "Open Python Shell" ||
|| {{{__message__}}} || contains the contents of the {{{message}}} parameter passed to the RevitPythonShell plugin when you clicked "Open Python Shell". On closing the InteractiveShell window, the contents of {{{__message__}}} will be assigned back, so Revit has access to it ||
|| {{{__elements__}}} || the {{{ElementSet}}} passed to the RevitPythonShell plugin when you clicked "Open Python Shell". ||
|| {{{__result__}}} || This is set to {{{IExternalCommand.Result.Succeeded}}}, but you can change it if you want. When the InteractiveShell is closed, the RevitPythonShell returns the contents of this variable as the result of the {{{IExternalCommand.Execute}}} method. ||
